# Good Vibes

A minimal Node.js HTTP server that serves a pixel art hello world page. No
dependencies — just the Node standard library.

## The page

`public/index.html` is a single self-contained file: a 320&times;180 canvas
scene, upscaled by an integer factor with nearest-neighbour filtering. There are
no images and no font files — the bitmap font, the sprites, the sky gradient and
the landscape are all drawn from data in the page itself, so the whole thing is
portable anywhere a browser runs.

Below the scene the page prints the style guide it was built from: the 16-colour
palette with hex values, and the sizes everything is authored at.

### Art conventions

These are the rules the scene follows. Keeping to them is what makes new art
look like it belongs with the old art.

| Thing              | Convention                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Resolution         | 320 &times; 180 internal, scaled by whole numbers only |
| Palette            | 16 colours, no exceptions, no blending                 |
| Font               | 5 &times; 7 bitmap, 1px tracking, ink outline          |
| Character sprites  | 12 &times; 16, 2 frames per animation                  |
| Gradients          | 4 &times; 4 ordered (Bayer) dither between palette stops |
| Depth              | Distant things lighter and bluer, near things darker   |

Fractional coordinates are the one thing to watch for: `fillRect` antialiases
them, and a soft edge is obvious the moment the canvas is scaled up.

## Deploying

The page is static, so anything that serves a file will do. To put it on
Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

`wrangler.toml` publishes `public/` as static assets under a worker named
`good-vibes-pixel`. It deliberately does not reuse an existing worker name —
deploying with someone else's name overwrites that worker.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer

## Running

```bash
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000.

The port and bind address can be overridden with environment variables:

```bash
PORT=8080 HOST=127.0.0.1 npm start
```

## Routes

| Route      | Response                          |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| `/`        | The pixel art hello world page    |
| `/healthz` | `{"status":"ok"}`                 |
| anything else | `404 Not Found`                |

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Layout

```
